# OpenGL GLUT Traffic Simulation
This project is an implementation of a simple traffic simulation using OpenGL. The simulation includes moving cars on a road with lanes and a clock that rotates. Users can control the movement of a car using the WASD keys, and the clock moves based on arrow key inputs. Additionally, left-clicking the mouse changes the background color to a daytime theme, and right-clicking changes it to a nighttime theme.

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have OpenGL installed on your system. This project uses the GLUT library for window management. All the code is found inside "main.cpp"

# How to Run
Compile the program using your preferred C++ compiler.
Run the executable.
Use the following controls:
WASD keys to control the movement of a *singular* car.
Arrow keys to move the clock.
Left-click to change to a daytime theme.
Right-click to change to a nighttime theme.
Press 'f' to toggle full-screen mode.
Press 'Esc' to exit the program.

# Features
Animated moving cars on the road.
Clock rotation based on arrow key inputs.
Daytime and nighttime themes.
Full-screen mode toggle.

Feel free to contribute and improve this simulation!
